<!-- Task Statement - 

Have you seen the different themes of the editors? There's a light theme, and there's a dark theme. We will be building today a toggle theme functionality where we will click a button to change the theme from dark to light.
The HTML and CSS are already provided to you.

The p element should have the text I am a Newton School student, ready to become an awesome full stack developer

The main div should have id="app" and class="day"

The buttonshould have id="swap" and class="button_day"

Write the swapTheme function to change the class of the div to night and the class of the button to button_night. Calling the swapTheme function again should change the class of the div back to day and the class of the button back to button_day

Cliking the button should call the swapTheme function.



Note: Do not change the CSS code -->


<div id="app" class="day">
    <p>I am a Newton School student, ready to become an awesome full stack developer</p>
    <button onclick="swapTheme()" id="swap" class="button_day">Toggle theme</button>
</div>
